Recently, there have been increasing calls for computer science curricula to complement existing technical training with topics related to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics. We present Value Cards, an educational toolkit to inform students and practitioners of the social impacts of different machine learning models via deliberation. 

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11411), we present an early use of our approach in the [Human-AI Interaction](https://haiicmu.github.io/) Course at CMU, Fall 2020. Through an in-class activity, we report empirical data for the initial effectiveness of our approach. 

Our results suggest that the use of the Value Cards toolkit can **(a)** improve students' understanding of both the technical definitions and trade-offs of performance metrics and apply them in real-world contexts, **(b)** help them recognize the significance of considering diverse social values in the development of deployment of algorithmic systems, and **(c)** enable them to communicate, negotiate and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders.

Through out the study design and development, we paid special attention to the limitation of persona card.
