### _In Proceeding of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '21)_

Recently, there have been increasing calls for computer science curricula to complement existing technical training with topics related to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE). We present **Value Cards**, an educational toolkit to inform students and practitioners of the social impacts of different machine learning models via deliberation. 

**Value Cards** emcompasses three main three main components: 
- **Model Cards**. Inspired by and adopted from [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993).
- **Persona Cards**. Inspired by [Envisioning Cards](https://www.envisioningcards.com/)
- **Checklist Cards**. Inspired by and adopted from [Co-Designing Checklists to Understand Organizational Challenges and Opportunities around Fairness in AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/co-designing-checklists-to-understand-organizational-challenges-and-opportunities-around-fairness-in-ai/)

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11411) accepted by FAccT 2021, we present an early use of our approach in the [Human-AI Interaction](https://haiicmu.github.io/) course at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2020. Drawing insights from a one-hour, in-class <font color=red>virtual</font> activity participated by 56 college students, we report empirical data for the initial effectiveness of our approach.

Our results suggest that the use of **Value Cards** can:

> **(a)** improve students' understanding of both the technical definitions and trade-offs of performance metrics and apply them in real-world contexts 

> **(b)** help students recognize the significance of considering diverse social values in the development of deployment of algorithmic systems

> **(c)** enable students to communicate, negotiate and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders.

Hear what our students say:

> _"This was amazing! So much better than traditional lectures."_ -- **Anonymized post-activity survey**.

> _"I think that discussing the perspective of defendants while trying to choose a model really gave me a moment to step into the shoes of the defendants and 
> understand what the impacts of different decisions could have on them and others."_ -- **Anonymized post-activity survey**.

You can read more about our findings in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11411). It is worth mentioning that, through out the study design and development, we paid special attention to the limitation of **Persona Card**. In our activity instruction, we remind students that each stakeholder’s value offered in the Persona Cards should only be served as a starting point. Students are encouraged to enrich the persona background and celebrate stakeholders’ intersectionalities.

**<font color=red>For Instructors and Workshop Organizers</font>**:

As we received positive feedback and constructive critique from our students in our Human AI Interaction class, we are excited to share **Value Cards**, along with the complementary teaching materials we used in our remote activity, with instructors and workshop organizers.

- [Value Cards]() (Open to adoption)
  - We use [this interface](https://value-sensitive-viz.herokuapp.com/explore_scenario.html) to help us generate realistic models that emphasizing different performance metrics in the recidivism prediction setting.

- [Activity Rundown]()

- [Pre Quiz]() and [Post Quiz]()

- [Code Book]() generated through an inductive thematic analysis on the discussion transcripts of 14 teams (56 students).
